# ✨ The Symbolists of RANNTA  
**Specialists in Mythology, Gematria & Brand Symbolism**

We are a research-driven team specializing in ancient history, mythological systems, symbolic codes, and the esoteric science of gematria.  
Our mission is to help emerging tokens, DAOs, and symbolic brands express their identity with meaningful visual and linguistic power.

### What We Offer:
- ✦ Brand name guidance rooted in frequency and archetypes  
- ✦ Conceptual & mystical NFT design  
- ✦ Creation of seals, totems, and symbolic systems for crypto projects  
- ✦ Consultation on the energetic language of form, number, and myth  

> Choosing the right name and symbol for a brand, shop, or business isn't just about appearance — it's about **energy**, **identity**, and **long-term resonance**.

The names we help create are designed to carry **meaning**, **magnetism**, and **memorability**.  
Whether you're launching a startup, a token, or a sacred brand, we guide you through symbolic strategy aligned with **success** and **spiritual impact**.

**Directed by:** ILIYA  
Founder of the RANNTA initiative and lead architect of symbolic resonance.
