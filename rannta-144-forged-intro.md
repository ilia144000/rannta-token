## 🔢 Decoding `144-FORGED`

### 🔺 Why 144?
- In mathematics: A square of 12 — a symbol of balance, cycles, and structure.  
- In classical systems: Often used to represent completeness or structural harmony.  
- In digital frameworks: A compact, memorable code used to group elevated or qualified tokens.

### 🔥 What does "FORGED" imply?
Not mystical — but precise.  
"Forged" denotes an asset that has passed through internal vetting, validation, and refinement processes.  
It represents integrity, readiness, and eligibility for advanced ecosystem interactions.
