## 🔥 Project Description
**RANNTA COIN** is a symbolic, community-powered token built on The Open Network (TON).

It was born as a tribute to the devastating Los Angeles fire — a symbolic moment representing the collapse of meaning, structure, and collective spirit in modern systems.  
**RANNTA** rises as a spiritual and financial signal — a call to rebuild what was lost, in value and in soul.

We echo the energy behind the idea of _"Make America Great Again"_ — not in a political sense, but as a **universal longing to restore greatness** through rebirth, clarity, and symbolic power.

**RANNTA stands at the intersection of financial utility and mythic identity** — with the vision to help rebuild conscious value across Web3.
