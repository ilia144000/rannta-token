## 🔥 Project Description

**RANNTA COIN** is a symbolic, community-powered token built on **The Open Network (TON)**.

It was born as a tribute to **the devastating Los Angeles fire**, a symbolic moment representing the collapse of meaning, structure, and collective spirit in modern systems. RANNTA rises as a spiritual and financial signal — a call to rebuild what was lost, in value and in soul.

We echo the energy behind the idea of **"Make America Great Again"**, not in a political sense, but as a **universal longing to restore greatness** — through rebirth, clarity, and symbolic power.

RANNTA stands at the intersection of financial utility and mythic identity — with the vision to help rebuild conscious value across Web3.
