# 🌟 RANNTA — Symbolic Crypto-Art & Token Ecosystem

RANNTA is a **symbolic, immutable, community-powered token** on the **TON blockchain**.  
It unites **financial tokenomics** with **mythic–conceptual arts**, rooted in  
**Mythosymbolic Fractalism (MSF)** — a synthesis of geometry, myth, sacred codes,  
and encrypted digital frequencies.

Born in the ashes of the Los Angeles fire — a symbolic collapse of structure and meaning —  
RANNTA rises as a signal of **rebirth, clarity, and symbolic power**.  
Not political, but universal: a call to restore greatness through **value and soul**.
