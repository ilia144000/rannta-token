##  Project Description

RANNTA COIN is a symbolic, community-powered token built on The Open Network (TON).

It was born as a tribute to the devastating Los Angeles fire — a symbolic moment representing the collapse of meaning, structure, and collective spirit in modern systems.  
RANNTA rises as a spiritual and financial signal — a call to rebuild what was lost, in value and in soul.

We echo the energy behind the idea of "Make America Great Again" — not in a political sense, but as a universal longing to restore greatness through rebirth, clarity, and symbolic power.

RANNTA stands at the intersection of **financial utility** and **mythic identity**, with a vision to help rebuild conscious value across Web3.

##  `144-FORGED`: Immutable Identity Layer

This token is sealed and immutable — no future changes to metadata or contract structure are possible.  
The `144-FORGED` code represents a finalized identity state, publicly verified and cryptographically bound.

>  A symbolic signal for tokens crafted with narrative, precision, and permanence.
