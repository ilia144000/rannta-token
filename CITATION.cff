  RANNTA is a symbolic, immutable token and cultural ecosystem on the TON blockchain.
  It merges transparent tokenomics with conceptual NFT collections, guided by the
  artistic philosophy of Mythosymbolic Fractalism (MSF). 
  The project bridges blockchain, art, and philanthropy, dedicating 25% of proceeds
  to children, environment, and cultural heritage.
